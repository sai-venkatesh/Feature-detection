# Feature-detection
This project is based on performing the task of Feature Detection by handling the real time dataset  to get more accuracy outcome.

Steps to be followed:
1.Import the libraries.
2.Import the dataset.
3.Perform the accuracy task using "Decision tree classifier".Note the accuracy.
4.Perform the accuracy task using "KNN classifier".Note the accuracy.
5.Perform the accuracy task using "SVM(support vector machine) classifier.Note the accuracy.
6.Now perform the task of Feauture detection by calculating "Correlation coefficient" values of the features of the dataset,And filter first 4 features having highest 'Correlation coefficient' values besides that outcome feature.
7.Now again Perform the task of accuracy using all three classifiers(Decision tree classifier,KNN classifier,SVM classifier).And compare the acuuracy values with previous values that are obtained in Steps 3,4,5.

By performing the task of "FEATURE DETECTION" we can conclude that 'the accuracy of the dataset is increases'.
